    <p>Let's face it. <b>Reading reddit <i>every day</i> kills
      productivity</b> as it is easy develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder">dependence</a> on browsing reddit to compensate for an otherwise (apparently) dull moment. Yet, reddit provides some informative links. I often enjoy reading the submissions and comments posted in the programming subreddit.
    </p>
    
    <p>This site helps you to <u>establish a habit</u> to <b>read reddit once a week only</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>How? Simply add the following feed to your feed reader <b>and</b> never visit reddit except through the weekly feed updates.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <a href="/rss/programming"><b>r/programming</b></a> [rss - weekly]
    </p>
    
    <p>To subscribe to other sub reddits, in the above URL simply change <code>/rss/programming</code> to <code>/rss/yoursubreddit</code>. To subscribe to the main reddit, use <a href="/rss">this link</a>. </p>

    <p><b>How it works</b>: the RSS feed is updated every week with the links from the "top" page for "this week" (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&t=week">example</a>). Effectively this only includes highest-voted links submitted in the last 7 days.</p>
